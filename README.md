OutlookTfsAddin
===============

The Outlook add-in that provides the ability to register a new TFS item (task, bug) right-clicking on the particular mail item.

The team foundation server is required to be accessible and you have an account with permissions to create work items. The add-in provides a simple form to connect to the TFS server and set required workitem properties (item type, project, area, iteration, assigned user) as well as item's subjects and comment. All additional email resources (images, archives etc) would be saved to the new workitem as file attachments. The add-in contains single form with all required fields and buttons. To start working with, you need to install the add-in and you need an existing TFS account.
